<p>The Companies Act definition is narrow in so far as it relates to when companies should file for Business Rescue. In terms of section 128, financial distress means that the company is unlikely to meet all its debt obligations as they become due in the next six months and there is a reasonable likelihood that the company will be insolvent in the next six months. 
The signs of financial distress are however much wider and it is important for Boards of Companies to act in time to avoid the need for Business Rescue and failing which liquidation of the business. Some of the indicators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Declining revenues including loss of key contracts</li>
<li>• Decline in operating margins</li>
<li>• Increase in accounts receivable days</li>
<li>• Increase in accounts payable days</li>
<li>• Build-up of inventories</li>
<li>• Lack of liquidity / exceeding banking facilities</li>
<li>• Industrial action, staff and management turnover</li>
<li>• Failure to meet debt obligations including a breach in debt covenants</li>
<li>• Unresolved redemption of debt that its due in the medium term</li>
<li>• Lack of adequate and timely financial and IFRS reporting</li>
<li>• Absence of management accounts and budgets monitoring </li>
<li>• Downgrading of the company by its credit rating agency</li>
</ul>

<p>Business Rescue is a process provided for in terms of Section 128 of the Companies Act. It is proceedings to facilitate the rehabilitation of a company that is financial distressed by providing for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>• The temporary supervision of the company and of the management of its affairs, business and property</li>
  <li>• A temporary moratorium on the rights of claimants against the company or in respect of property in its possession </li>
  <li>• The development and implementation, if approved, of a plan to rescue the company or, if that is not possible a plan that would achieve a better return for the company’s creditors that the payment they would receive if the company had simply been liquidated immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Business Rescue proceedings may be instituted upon the passing of a resolution by the directors of the company which could also be endorsed by the court. It could also be initiated by Court Action by an Affected Person which includes members of the company, creditors and employees. The company files a Notice of Commencement of Business Rescue Proceedings in the prescribed manner with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (“CIPC”). This is followed by the appointment of a Business Rescue Practitioner in the prescribed form with the CIPC within 5 Business Days. <br><br>Notices are required to be sent to affected persons as prescribed. The BRP is required to engage with Affected Persons and publish the Business Rescue Plan within 25 business days from appointment unless extension is obtained from creditors or the Court. If the Business Rescue proceedings have not been terminated after three months, the BRP is required to provide progress reports to the CIPC in the prescribed form. The proceedings end in a number of circumstances including the filing of a notice of termination by the BRP or a notice of substantial implementation.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between a Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) and a Business Rescue Practitioner?</h2>

<div class="accordion-content">
<p>The CRO and BRP are appointed in different circumstances. The CRO (who may also be a registered Business Rescue Practitioner) is appointed by the Board of the company or its funders and investors in an informal turnaround situation. The BRP is appointed by the company by filing a notice of appointment with CIPC. The BRP has wide ranging powers and effectively takes over full management of the company from the Board and Management. The BRP may only be removed from office by an order of Court in terms of section 130 and section 139. The BRP becomes an Officer of the Court and has prescribed responsibilities in terms of the Act. <br><br>CRO is a term borrowed from the UK and the US where it is more prevalent and refers to an Executive appointed on a temporary basis by the company to lead the Turnaround of the business.  Restructuring is a critical activity that requires strong and dedicated leadership to lead the company from financial distress to financial stability. The CRO is the leader of the restructuring and has three main responsibilities being to (a) bring credibility and objectivity to the restructuring process (b) driving and creating stability to the entire restructuring process (c) building consensus amongst stakeholders about the direction of the restricting. </p>
